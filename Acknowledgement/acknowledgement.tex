\textit{I would like to express my most sincere gratitude to my supervisor Professor Abbas Dehghani-Sanji, and to Dr Uriel Martinez Hernandez for guiding me through the development of this project. I would also like to thank my family for supporting me during the most difficult times, despite of the enormous distance between us. I am very grateful to my wife, who accompanied me during the most challenging stages of this life experience, and for encouraging me when I needed it the most. I would also like to thank all my friends and the many people who directly or indirectly were involved in this personal goal. Lastly, I would like to thank my financial sponsor, the Consejo de Nacional de Ciencia Y Tecnologia (CONACYT).}
